            <i>The C++ Standard Library From Scratch</i> walks you through the
analysis, design and implementation of a functioning personal information
manager (PIM) using strings, streams, and the Standard Template Library. You
will learn all the critical programming concepts and techniques associated with
the Standard Library in the context of creating a working application, the
"TinyPIM" address and calendar application. Every example builds the
application throughout the book. In the end, you will have created an
application that allows you to track contacts, sort addresses, and enter events
and appointments.
