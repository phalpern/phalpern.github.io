Welcome to <i>Jesse Liberty's Programming From Scratch series</i>. I created
this series because I believe that traditional primers do not meet the
needs of every student. A typical introductory computer programming book
teaches a series of skills in logical order and then, when you have mastered
a topic, the book endeavors to show how the skills might be applied. This
approach works very well for many people, but not for everyone.
<p>I've taught programming to over 10,000 students: in small groups, large
groups, and through the Internet. Many students have told me that they
wish they could just sit down at the computer with an expert and work on
a program together. Rather than being taught each skill step by step in
a vacuum, they'd like to create a product and learn the necessary skills
as they go.
<p>From this idea was born the Programming From Scratch series. In each
of these books, an industry expert will guide you through the design and
implementation of a complex program, starting from scratch and teaching
you the necessary skills as you go.
<p>You may want to make a From Scratch book the first book you read on
a subject, or you may prefer to read a more traditional primer first and
then use one of these books as supplemental reading. Either approach can
work: which is better depends on your personal learning style.
<p>All of the From Scratch series books share a common commitment to showing
you the entire development process, from the initial concept through implementation.
We do not assume you know anything about the subject: From Scratch means
from the very beginning, with no prior assumptions.
<p>While I didn't write every book in the series, as Series Editor I have
a powerful sense of personal responsibility for each one. I provide supporting
material and a discussion group on my Web site (<a href="http://www.libertyassociates.com">www.libertyassociates.com</a>),
and I encourage you to write to me at <a href="mailto:jliberty@libertyassociates.com">jliberty@libertyassociates.com</a>
if you have questions or concerns.
<p>Thank you for considering this book.
