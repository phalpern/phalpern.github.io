<a NAME="WhatMakesDifferent"></a>
<p><b><font face="Helvetica"><font size=+1>What Makes This Book Different?</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">This book is different from any primer on this
topic <i>ever</i> written. Here's the difference: All other programming
books start by teaching you simple skills which build in difficulty, adding
skill on skill as you go. When you've learned all the skills, the books
then demonstrate what you can do: a sample program.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino"><i>This</i> book does not start with a list of
classes and functions; it starts with a project. You begin by analyzing
and designing the project and then you implement that design. Standard
library features are taught in the context of implementation; first you
understand what you are trying to accomplish, and then you learn the skills
and library features needed to get the job done.</font>
<p><b><font face="Helvetica">Learning the Standard Library Doesn't Have
to Be Difficult</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">Many people find the C++ Standard Library to be
intimidating. I believe this is because most books and courses focus on
the set of features supplied by the library, rather than on the problem
these features help you solve. The C++ Standard Library is so large that
trying to learn it this way is like trying to learn French by memorizing
a French dictionary.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">There are two ways to learn to speak a foreign
language. One way is to memorize dozens of vocabulary words and practice
declension of verbs. The other is to go to the country and interact with
native speakers. Different people learn differently, but I can tell you
that in my experience a week in France is worth two years in the classroom.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">If I were going to teach you the C++ Standard
Library and we worked together, I would not hand you a book at all. I'd
sit down with you and we'd write a program together. Along the way, I'd
teach you what you need to know, occasionally giving you short pieces to
read to flesh out your understanding.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">That is exactly how this book works: we'll sit
down together and write a program, and along the way I'll teach you what
you need to know. From the very first page, you will focus on understanding
the problem you are trying to solve, and designing a solution, rather than
on a list of features.</font>

be the first book you read after learning C++, I have included a number

simply skip these excursions.</font></td>

<p><b><font face="Helvetica">Learning to Make Choices Among Library Constructs</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">One drawback of the other teaching approaches
is that you get bombarded with a set of features with little guidance on
how to choose among them. Because you are working through a real program,
I can explain alternative ways of solving a problem and describe why we
choose a particular solution. Returning to the foreign language analogy,
you will learn not only the legal way to use library constructs, but the
<i>idiomatic</i>
use of those constructs.</font>
<p><img SRC="Geek.gif" ALT="Geek Speak" height=39 width=44 align=LEFT><font face="Palatino">An
<i>Idiom</i>
is a customary way of using a programming construct or feature. The meaning
of an idiomatic construct is understood as a whole, without having to analyze
the individual parts.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Using idioms reduces the amount of thinking you
have to do and it makes your code easier to maintain by other people who
understand the idioms.</font>
<p><a NAME="WhyLearn"></a><b><font face="Helvetica"><font size=+1>Why Should
I Learn the C++ Standard Library?</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">The official standard for the C++ language is
a 776-page long document (ISO/IEC 14882, 1998). About half of that document
is devoted to the library of functions and classes that are provided with
standard-conforming compilers. If you use C++ without understanding the
Standard Library, you know only half the story.</font>

<td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#D5D500"><font face="Arial">If you do not already
know how to program in C++, put this book down right now. Run (do not walk)
to the store where you bought this book and buy Jesse Liberty's <i>C++
From Scratch</i> (ISBN: 0-7897-2079-5). When you are finished reading <i>C++
From Scratch</i>, you can resume reading this book where you left off.</font></td>

<p><font face="Palatino">A large part of programming involves mundane tasks
such as managing collections of objects, manipulating text strings, searching,
sorting, and performing formatted input and output. Though conceptually
simple, many of these tasks are tedious and some are hard to get right.
Do you really want to implement a sort algorithm yourself? What are the
chances of introducing a subtle bug that only shows up when, say, sorting
arrays that contain three elements with the same value?</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Proper use of the library increases the portability
of your programs to different compilers and operating systems. The use
of standard library classes for data interchange is becoming increasingly
common as more and more third-party libraries use standard classes in their
interfaces.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">By learning about the Standard Library, you can
avoid reinventing the wheel. The features of the Standard Library are there
to make your programs easier to write and more robust. The people who maintain
your code will thank you for using well-understood facilities instead of
inventing your own. (Okay, they might not actually thank you, but they'll
be grateful inside and at least they won't curse you.)</font>
<p><b><font face="Helvetica">What Is the C++ Standard Library?</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">The C++ Standard Library is really two things.
In the classical sense, it is a set of types and functions, which come
ready-to-use with a <i>standards-conforming compiler</i>.</font>
<p><img SRC="Geek.gif" ALT="Geek Speak" height=39 width=44 align=LEFT><font face="Palatino">A
<i>library</i>
is a set of reusable components (classes, functions, macros, and so on)
intended to help a programmer perform a set of tasks. A library can be
special purpose (for example, Internet programming) or general purpose
(for example, sorting).</font>
<p><img SRC="Geek.gif" ALT="Geek Speak" height=39 width=44 align=LEFT><font face="Palatino">A
<i>standard
library</i> is a library whose contents and behavior are described in a
document issued by a standards body (for example, the International Standards
Organization, ISO). Unless otherwise stated, "standard library" is used
here as an easier way to say "C++ Standard Library" -- that is, the library
described in the ISO C++ standard.</font>
<p><img SRC="Geek.gif" ALT="Geek Speak" height=39 width=44 align=LEFT><font face="Palatino">A
<i>standards-conforming
compiler</i> is a compiler and library that correctly implements the behavior
described in the ISO standard for the C++ language and library.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">But the C++ Standard Library is also an <i>extensible
framework</i> for creating additional library components. Most of your
work with the Standard Library will not involve creating new components.
But for those 10% of the cases where new components are needed, the power
of the library proves to be extraordinary. It is the ability to create
new library components that distinguishes skilled library users from novices.
With this book, I hope to move you a substantial distance down the road
towards being a skilled library user.</font>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Parts of the Standard Library</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Ten smaller libraries together comprise the C++
Standard Library. They are</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Palatino">The Language Support Library, which contains types
and functions directly related to the language and compiler. For example,
there are constants that define the range and precision of floating point
numbers and functions for exiting a program.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Palatino">The Diagnostics library, which contains exception
classes and other facilities for detecting and reporting errors.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Palatino">The General Utilities Library, which contains useful
facilities not easily categorized into one of the other libraries.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Palatino">The Strings Library, for manipulating text strings.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Palatino">The Localization Library, for handling international
character sets and culturally specific formatting of things such as time,
date, and currency.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Palatino">The Containers Library, which provides generic containers
for collecting objects.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Palatino">The Iterators Library, for traversing items in a
collection.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Palatino">The Algorithms Library, which implements many commonly
used data-manipulation algorithms.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Palatino">The Numerics Library, which provides complex numbers,
special numeric array types, and numeric algorithms.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Palatino">The Input/Output Library, for performing portable
formatted and unformatted input and output to files and other devices.</font></li>
</ol>
<font face="Helvetica">Which Parts Are Really Useful?</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">The ten libraries aren't equally useful. Some
libraries you will use every day, whereas others you might never use. This
book concentrates on the five libraries that I consider most useful in
day-to-day use: Strings, Containers, Iterators, Algorithms and Input/Output.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Conversely, not everything that could be useful
was included in the Standard Library. The ISO (International Standards
Organization) committee responsible for creating the International C++
Language Standard reviewed hundreds of proposals for features that could
have been added to the standard. They attempted to include only those features
that are of the most general use and that had well-constructed proposals.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">In retrospect, many generally useful features
were omitted, whereas other less generally useful features were included.
As we go along, I will point out some of the more glaring omissions. I
won't bore you with all the obscure features that are hardly ever used.
In picking and choosing, I am in a sense second-guessing the ISO committee
members that slaved over the standard for so long. This is my prerogative
as an author with 20/20 hindsight and I make no apologies.</font>
<p><font face="Helvetica">What About Those Library Features I Used to Use
in C?</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">If you programmed in C before learning C++, you
are probably familiar with a number of library functions that are part
of the C Standard Library. These functions -- such as <u>printf</u>, <u>strcpy</u>,
<u>atoi</u>,
and so on -- are still available to you in the C++ Standard Library and
you will explore a number of them in this book. Some parts of the C library,
such as the input/output functions, are rarely used in C++ because more
sophisticated components are available in the C++ library. Other parts
of the C library, however, continue to be valuable for writing C++ programs.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">The C Standard Library underwent a few changes
when it was incorporated into the C++ Standard Library. To begin with,
the header files have changed names. For example, <u>stdio.h</u> was renamed
to <u>cstdio</u>. The rule is the same for the other headers: Remove the
<u>.h</u>
and put a lowercase <u>c</u> in front.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Taking advantage of the capability to overload
function names in C++, some functions were changed to make better use of
<u>const</u>.
For example, the C function</font>
<p><font face="Courier"><font size=-1>char* strchr(const char* s, char
c);</font></font>
<p><font face="Palatino">has been replaced in C++ with the following two
overloaded functions:</font>
<p><font face="Courier"><font size=-1>const char* strchr(const char* s,
char c);</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier"><font size=-1>char* strchr( char* s, char c);</font></font>
<p><font face="Palatino">The first form searches for a character within
a array of <u>const</u> characters and returns a <u>const</u> pointer to
the first one. The second form works for a non-<u>const</u> array and returns
a non-<u>const</u> pointer. This closes a <u>const</u>-safety hole in the
C version of the function, which returned a non-<u>const</u> pointer into
a potentially <u>const</u> array.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Overloading also provides multiple versions of
floating-point math functions for the different size floating-point number
types. For example, the C function</font>
<p><font face="Courier"><font size=-1>double sin(double);</font></font>
<p><font face="Palatino">has been replaced in C++ with</font>
<p><font face="Courier"><font size=-1>float sin(float);</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier"><font size=-1>double sin(double);</font></font>
<p><font face="Palatino">and</font>
<p><font face="Courier"><font size=-1>long double sin(long double);</font></font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Finally, all components inherited from the C library
except macros have been put into the <u>std</u> namespace. (The macros
from the C library are still available but, since macros do not obey scoping
rules, they cannot be assigned to a namespace.) We delve further into the
<u>std</u>
namespace in the next chapter.</font>
<p><b><font face="Helvetica">Is the Standard Library the Same as STL?</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">STL stands for <i>Standard Template Library</i>.
The term refers to a set of <i>interfaces</i> and components developed
by Alexander Stepanov and others working at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories
and Hewlett-Packard Research Laboratories. Stepanov's goal was to realize
the potential of generic programming to create a standard set of reusable
components. Today, the STL comprises the Containers, Iterators, Algorithms,
and some of the General Utilities libraries within the C++ Standard Library.
In other words, STL is only a part of the Standard Library, albeit a very
important part. Much of this book is devoted to understanding and using
STL components.</font>
<p><img SRC="Geek.gif" ALT="Geek Speak" height=39 width=44 align=LEFT><font face="Palatino">An
<i>interface</i>
is any formal description of how a programmer or user gains access to the
capabilities of a function, class, macro, or any other component of the
system. Interface is an abstract programming concept, not a specific keyword
C++ construct.</font>
<p><img SRC="Geek.gif" ALT="Geek Speak" height=39 width=44 align=LEFT><font face="Palatino">A
<i>class
interface</i> describes the set of public functions, types, and variables
in a class.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="Geek.gif" ALT="Geek Speak" height=39 width=44 align=LEFT><font face="Palatino">A
<i>function
interface</i> describes the set of argument types and the return type for
a function (i.e., its <i>prototype</i>).</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Helvetica">Design Goals of the STL</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">When the main ideas of the STL were presented
to the C++ standardization committee in late 1993, they were received enthusiastically.
So rare was it that a proposal could satisfy so many goals simultaneously.
The STL successfully achieved the following design goals:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Palatino"><b>General usefulness </b>When learned, STL components
become part of the bread-and-butter of everyday programming. The STL uses
templates to create components that can be applied to a wide range of programming
problems.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Palatino"><b>Simplicity </b>Although STL is not without complexity,
the most commonly used components have small, easy-to-learn interfaces.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Palatino"><b>Efficiency </b>The use of templates enables the
library to be very efficient in runtime processing. Templates translate
a general-purpose component at compile-time into a special-purpose implementation.
In addition, the STL components provide specific performance guarantees,
enabling you to choose the most efficient component for your task.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Palatino"><b>Flexibility </b>The components of the STL are
small and designed to be combined in infinite combinations. You can often
change your mind and substitute one component for another with very little
ripple effect on the code.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Palatino"><b>Extensibility </b>The STL is not simply a bunch
of components, but a set of <i>interfaces</i>. You can add new components
to the framework merely by adopting the STL interfaces. Your new component
will work seamlessly with the existing ones.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Palatino">If you have been hearing a lot about the STL and
were wondering what all of the excitement was about, now you know. Anything
that can promise this much is bound to cause excitement.</font>
<p><a NAME="WhatTools"></a><b><font face="Helvetica"><font size=+1>What
Tools Do I Need?</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">Theoretically, you could read this book without
ever touching a computer. However, in order to get the most out of it,
you're going to want to compile some or all of the sample code in the book,
perhaps modifying it to experiment with the library features. I also suggest
that you try to solve the exercises organized by chapter on the support
web site, <a href="http://www.halpernwightsoftware.com/stdlib-scratch/support.html">http://www.halpernwightsoftware.com/stdlib-scratch/support.html</a>.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">In order to compile and run the programs in this
book, you will need a text editor or Integrated Development Environment
(IDE), a modern C++ compiler, and the standard library itself.</font>
<p><b><font face="Helvetica">What Compilers Will Work?</font></b>
<p><font face="Palatino">This book is based on the C++ language as standardized
by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in July 1998. Theoretically,
therefore, any standards-conforming compiler will work equally well. As
of this writing, however, standards-conforming compilers are rare. Compilers
vary as to which features of Standard C++ they have not yet implemented.
Some compilers are so hopelessly behind that they cannot effectively support
a commercial-grade version of the Standard Library. You should avoid any
compiler that predates the December 1996 draft of the ISO standard. In
fact, few compilers from before 1998 are usable with the standard library.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">The examples in this book have been tested with
the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler on Windows and the GNU egcs 1.1.2
compiler on UNIX/Linux. The egcs compiler is the next-generation of the
GNU compiler and is substantially closer to ISO conformance than the older
GNU compiler. It is available for free on the Web at <a href="http://egcs.cygnus.com/">http://egcs.cygnus.com/</a>.
Note that the egcs compiler has been improved and is now called GCC 2.95.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">The other popular compiler that should work for
Microsoft Windows is the Borland compiler that comes with C++ Builder 4.0.
(This is not the Borland C++ 4.0 compiler, which is quite old and insufficient
for supporting the standard library.) On UNIX and other operating systems,
the compilers from KAI and those derived from the Edison Group compiler
have received favorable reviews for standards conformance.</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Because Sun's Solaris operating system is a popular
software development platform, it is worth singling out the SunPro 5.0
compiler as another compiler you can use for programming with the standard
library. The previous version of the SunPro compiler, 4.2, is marginally
usable for standard library programming with some workarounds.</font>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Compiler Notes</font>
<p><font face="Palatino">Even among the compilers listed earlier, there
are errors, flaws, and idiosyncrasies that differ from compiler to compiler.
In cases where I can identify these idiosyncrasies, I will flag them for
you using a note that looks like this:</font>
<br>&nbsp;

The XYZ compiler fails to recognize the <u>#include</u> directive. The
work around is to concatenate all your source files and the standard library
headers into a single, huge, monstrosity.</font></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><font face="Palatino">Some compiler notes will apply to a whole class
of compilers (for example, pre-1998 compilers), whereas others will apply
to a specific compiler. The examples in this book have not been compiled
on every compiler on the market, or even on every compiler mentioned here.
Take advantage of the tips in the Compiler Notes, but know that I have
certainly missed many opportunities for enlightening you on potential compiler
problems. If my Compiler Notes seem to be picking on the Microsoft compiler,
it is only because it is the one on which I have done the most testing.
The fact that Microsoft owns most of the world (or at least most of the
market) also makes their compiler a reasonable subject for thorough coverage.</font>
<p><b><font face="Helvetica">Where Do I Get the Standard Library?</font></b>
