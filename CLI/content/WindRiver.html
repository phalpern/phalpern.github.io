        <H2>Introduction</H2>

        <P>This white paper describes the advantages of Halpern-Wight
        Software&#8217;s <A HREF="../index.html">CLI Power Tools</A> to
        WindRiver&#8217;s RapidControl for CLI based on our evaluation
        of WindRiver&#8217;s offerings as of April, 2001. The contents
        of this white paper represents our opinion.</P>

        <P>The purpose of both products is to simplify and accelerate
        the development process for creating a command line interface
        (CLI) for network-connected devices. In both products, a
        development tool generates C or C++ code based on a
        developer&#39;s description of the syntax and semantics of
        commands, modes, etc.. The generated code is compiled and
        linked with a run-time library to produce the final CLI. The
        run-time library provides command-line editing, parsing, and
        some error checking and can be hosted on a different platform
        from the development tools (cross-compilation).</P>

        <H2>Differences in Usage Model</H2>

        <P>The development tools for the two products work on
        substantially different usage models. CLI Power Tools was
        initially created for a specific project. In the early stages
        of that project, we considered using RapidControl for CLI and
        rejected it based on our perception of deficiencies in the
        usage model. Although developing a new tool cost more, we did
        not regret the decision. For the following reasons, it is our
        opinion that CLI Power Tools has the better usage model:</P>

        <UL>
            <LI>
                <P><STRONG>Text files vs. GUI</STRONG>: The most
                important difference between the products is the
                mechanics of creating commands. CLI Power Tools uses a
                traditional edit-compile cycle for defining commands.
                Commands are created in the CDL language using a
                conventional text editor (emacs, vi, notepad, etc.).
                The CDL compiler and linker are used to generate C++
                code, which is compiled and linked with the run-time
                library into an executable image.</P>

                <P>RapidControl for CLI uses a graphical tool called
                the <EM>integration tool</EM> to define commands. The
                user adds <EM>nodes</EM> to a <EM>command tree</EM> and
                fills in dialog-box forms for parameters, code, etc.. A
                command is then used to generate C code, which is
                compiled and linked with the run-time library to create
                an executable image.</P>

                <P>Graphical interfaces can be handy, but we believe
                that the RapidControl GUI gets in the way.
                WindRiver&#8217;s GUI is not simply a wizard that gives
                you a head start and then leaves you to your coding
                tasks; it is the only practical way commands can be
                created or modified. To define a new command, you must
                go through a half-dozen dialog boxes or more. Modifying
                a parameter can cause any code you entered to be lost,
                so you must be careful to cut-and-paste your code into
                a temporary file before making changes to the parameter
                list. The process of creating and changing commands can
                get tedious for large numbers of commands. (The Cisco
                CLI has several hundred commands.)</P>

                <P>CLI Power Tools requires that you learn the CDL
                language. However, the language is small and example
                files are provided which make the learning process
                quick and easy. In our opinion, there is actually less
                to learn this way than with the GUI.</P>
            </LI>

            <LI>
                <P><STRONG>Independent command definitions vs. tree
                structure:</STRONG> With CLI Power Tools each command
                is defined independently; it is the job of the CDL
                linker to reconcile different commands that share a
                common prefix. The part of the CDL used to define a
                command&#8217;s syntax resembles the way command
                descriptions are found in Cisco (and other) user
                manuals, e.g. square brackets designate optional
                parameters, bars separate choices, etc.</P>

                <P>The RapidControl integration tool displays a tree of
                nodes. Commands with a common prefix share the same
                branch of the tree, so each command is always created
                in the context of all other commands. This can be seen
                as an advantage in that it is impossible to create
                inconsistencies that will need to be resolved later.
                However, it is also somewhat artificial. When creating
                a command set, it should be the tool&#8217;s job to
                create the parse tree, not the user&#8217;s job. The
                fact that the command, &quot;show ip ospf&quot;
                consists of three nodes in a tree is of little interest
                to the developer.</P>
            </LI>

            <LI>
                <P><STRONG>Independent files vs. centralized
                integration tool</STRONG>: With CLI Power Tools,
                separate commands can be put in separate text files and
                managed with any standard revision control system
                (Clearcase, RCS, CVS, etc.). Several developers can
                simultaneously edit unrelated command files with little
                fear of tripping over one another.</P>

                <P>RapidControl for CLI stores its command tree in a
                large XML file. Only one person can edit the command
                tree at a time. Although the XML file can be kept under
                revision control, merging simultaneous changes from
                several different developers is likely to be a
                nightmare, if it is even possible. XML may be text, but
                it is not easy to make sense of it in a merge window.
                Although RapidControl allows for some independent
                development, the integration is still the job of an
                individual using the graphical tool.</P>
            </LI>

            <LI>
                <P><STRONG>True human-readable files vs. XML:</STRONG>
                CLI Power Tools files are handcrafted, can be annotated
                with comments, and are as readable as the developer
                wants to make them. WindRiver claims that their
                RapidControl project file is human-readable because it
                is stored as XML and XML is a text format. We consider
                this characterization to be a stretch. XML is designed
                to be written by computers and read by computers.
                Although a person could muddle through it, XML is not
                designed to be human readable. (If you doubt this, try
                viewing the source of a Web page containing a table.
                The HTML format is similar to XML.) If fact, we
                consider any code generated by a software tool to be
                something you&#8217;d rather not have to read.</P>

                <P>The consequence of WindRiver&#8217;s use of XML is
                that revision control is more difficult &#8211;
                differences between versions are hard to understand and
                merging changes made by different programmers would be
                error-prone, at best.</P>

        <H2>CLI Power Tools Features</H2>

        <P>The features listed below are unique to CLI Power Tools and
        are not provided by RapidControl for CLI.</P>

        <UL>
            <LI><STRONG>Enhanced Cisco-compatible syntax:</STRONG> When
            people speak of a <EM>Cisco-compatible</EM> command set,
            they are usually referring to the ability to run Cisco
            scripts with few, if any, modifications. CLI Power Tools
            allows for the construction of a Cisco-compatible command
            set (as does RapidControl, we think), but also allows some
            nice backward-compatible enhancements, such as the ability
            to run a <EM>show</EM> command without leaving the current
            configuration mode.</LI>

            <LI><STRONG>Guard conditions:</STRONG> Sometimes a command
            cannot be executed because of the state of the system. For
            example, a command that configures Ethernet cards cannot be
            run if there are no Ethernet cards in the box. CLI Power
            Tools allow you to create <EM>guard conditions</EM> that
            prevent the command from executing or even from showing up
            in help.</LI>

            <LI><STRONG>Mode preconditions:</STRONG> Sometimes the
            state of the system can change such that the current
            command mode becomes invalid. If, for example, while you
            are configuring a card, that card were physically removed
            from the system, you would like to be notified in a
            friendly way. CLI Power Tools lets you define preconditions
            for modes, which are checked prior to executing any command
            within that mode. If the precondition fails, the command is
            disallowed with a human-readable error message and the mode
            is exited.</LI>

            <LI><STRONG>Macros:</STRONG> CLI Power Tool&#8217;s macro
            capability allows you to define a segment of syntax once
            and re-use it in many different commands. If a macro is
            changed, all commands that use that macro will change
            accordingly. RapidControl allows cutting-and-pasting of
            command nodes, but does not automatically propagate
            changes.</LI>

            <LI><STRONG>Mode-transition Commands:</STRONG> In CLI Power
            Tools, defining a mode is separate from defining the
            command(s) that enter that mode. This allows a mode to be
            selected using program logic based, for example, on a
            command parameter or the state of the system.</LI>

            <LI><STRONG>Command Generation:</STRONG> CLI Power Tools
            allows you to attach a piece of code to each command which,
            when called, will reproduce the original user input based
            on the current state of the system - in effect telling you
            what command would get you to the current state. This is
            very handy for implementing the &#8220;<TT>show
            config</TT>&#8221; command in Cisco&#8217;s IOS.</LI>

            <LI><STRONG>Direct Access to Command Parameters:</STRONG>
            When writing the code to implement a command in CLI Power
            Tools, the developer sees each parameter as a simple
            variable of the appropriate type containing a the value
            specified by the user. By way of contrast, RapidControl for
            CLI requires the use of arcane parameter retrieval
            functions combined with type-conversion functions.</LI>

            <LI><STRONG>True Custom Data Types:</STRONG> Each
            user-defined CLI data type is mapped to a user-specified
            C/C++ type. There is no need to call conversion functions
            within the execute code. In addition, the syntax of
            user-defined types can affect how the parser works; you are
            not limited to words delimited by white space.</LI>
        </UL>

        <H2>RapidControl for CLI Features</H2>

        <P>Clearly, this white paper is focused on the things that, in
        our opinion, make CLI Power Tools a superior choice for most
        CLI projects. In fairness to WindRiver, however, we will point
        out some of features in RapidControl for CLI that are absent in
        our own offering. See WindRiver&#8217;s marketing materials for
        more information.</P>

        <UL>
            <LI><STRONG>More Mature Offering:</STRONG> RapidControl for
            CLI has been around longer and has a much larger company
            behind it.</LI>

            <LI><STRONG>Integrated solution:</STRONG> RapidControl for
            CLI is a single <EM>blade</EM> on the <EM>RapidControl
            Backplane (RCB)</EM>. Other blades include a small web
            server, Java server, and SNMP integration package. All of
            the blades can share information through the RCB. Whether
            this benefits you or not depends on your overall
            project.</LI>

            <LI><STRONG>Data Model Support:</STRONG> The RCB contains a
            repository of <EM>RapidMarks</EM> &#8211; data items that
            provide user-specified set/get logic. The RapidMarks
            provide a uniform way for all the blades on the RCB to
            access data and underlying hardware functionality. Their
            <EM>MibWay</EM> product (available at extra cost) creates a
            connection between RapidMarks and SNMP Mib variables.</LI>
        </UL>

        <H2>Price</H2>

        <P>It would be inappropriate to quote prices for either product
        here, as price information is quickly outdated.</P>

        <P>In general terms, however:</P>

        <UL>
            <LI>RapidControl for CLI without any consulting is about
            twice as expensive as CLI Power Tools, which includes some
            consulting to help you customize the tool for your
            project.</LI>

            <LI>WindRiver charges royalties for the distribution of the
            run-time libraries. We do not.</LI>

            <LI>For command line interfaces with more than 30 or 40
            commands, either product will save you money vs. starting
            from scratch. We&#39;ve seen CLI Power Tools save over 80%
            of the resources needed to implement 300 or more
            commands.</LI>
        </UL>

        <H2>Conclusion</H2>

        <P>CLI Power Tools offers significant advantages over
        RapidControl for CLI. Key among these advantages are efficiency
        in creating and modifying commands and integrating commands
        created by multiple developers. Most developers will find the
        CLI Power Tools usage model to more natural and comfortable.
        For moderate to large command-line interfaces, CLI Power Tools
        can save significant amounts of time and money.</P>
