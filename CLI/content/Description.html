        <P><B><BIG>CLI Power Tools</BIG></B> is a command-line
        interface (CLI) development tool for embedded software
        developers that dramatically decreases the resources needed to
        develop a high-quality CLI. Unlike some other packages, it is
        designed for team development and can produce a truly
        Cisco-compliant CLI.</P>

        <P>If you need to develop a CLI for a network-based hardware or
        software product, <B><BIG>CLI Power Tools</BIG></B> could cut 3
        to 6 months off the development time. Here&#39;s how it
        works:</P>

        <P>You describe individual commands in a simple Command
        Description Language (CDL). The CDL file describes the syntax
        of the command, including keywords, parameters, optional
        parameters, repeating parameters, parameter ranges,
        context-sensitive help messages, modes, and privileges. Each
        command also has a piece of code attached to actually execute
        its action. (Currently the code can be C or C++, although other
        languages are being implemented.) A CDL compiler and linker
        check for errors and generate run-time data structures which
        are used by a run-time parser to recognize commands, provide
        context-sensitive help, provide command completion, and perform
        range and error checks.</P>

        <P>Because so much of the work is performed by the CLI
        infrastructure, each command can be implemented simply; the
        developer does not need to worry about being called in the
        wrong mode or with invalid parameters. Because command
        descriptions can be distributed among as many separate CDL
        source files as desired, the infrastructure is revision-control
        friendly and allows multiple developers to work on the CLI at
        once without stepping on one-another&#39;s toes.</P>

        <P>The generated program has the look and feel you&#39;d expect
        from a mature CLI, including all of the features found in the
        CLI for Cisco routers:</P>

        <UL>
            <LI>Command history and command-line editing.</LI>

            <LI>Context-specific help - Press the question-mark key at
            any time to see a list of legal next parameters, with
            descriptions.)</LI>

            <LI>Keyword completion - Type a partial keyword and press
            the <TT>&lt;tab&gt;</TT> key. The rest of the keyword will
            be entered automatically.</LI>

            <LI>Modes - Each command can belong to one or more modes.
            The command is not recognized (visible) in any other mode.
            Modes can be designed with sub-modes which inherit all of
            the commands of their parent modes.</LI>

            <LI>Privilege - Each command can be assigned a set of
            privilege attributes. A command may not be executed if the
            user does not have sufficient privilege</LI>

            <LI>Keyword abbreviations - Any keyword can be recognized
            just be typing an unambiguous prefix (e.g.,
            &quot;<TT>sh</TT>&quot; for
            &quot;<TT>show</TT>&quot;).</LI>

            <LI>Order-independent parameters - A command&#39;s syntax
            can be specified such that a set of parameters can be
            specified in any order. (e.g., &quot;<TT>run far
            fast</TT>&quot; could also be typed &quot;<TT>run fast
            far</TT>&quot;). The decision as to which parameters must
            be specified in a specific order and which parameters are
            order-independent is made by the developer on a per-command
            basis.</LI>

            <LI>Error checking - Before executing a command, the CLI
            checks that the current mode is still valid (e.g. the
            current interface card has not been disabled), the user has
            sufficient privilege, and each parameter is within the
            legal range, etc.. When possible, the user is alerted to
            the error by displaying a caret under the offending word
            along with an error message.</LI>

        kit:</P>

        <UL>
            <LI>Simple language for describing CLI commands. See the <A
            HREF="../QuickOverview.html">Command Description Language
            (CDL) Overview</A> (PDF format).</LI>

            <LI>Revision-control friendly - Each command can be in a
            separate source file, or related commands can be grouped
            into a single source file.</LI>

            <LI>Generated CLI is fast and memory-efficient - suitable
            for embedded systems.</LI>

            <LI>Can be ported to many different programming languages.
