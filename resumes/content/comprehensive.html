<blockquote>
	<p><font size="3">I will take your project through all or any
	part of the software-development life-cycle, whether working as
	either a team leader or as an individual contributor. I ensure
	that the project's needs are considered at every level of detail.
	When programming, I avoid quick-and-dirty solutions in favor of
	maintainable, extensible and efficient implementations. I also
	document my work with clearly written specifications, design
	documents, and/or test plans. I am expert in a number of programming
	and scripting languages and am quick to pick up new languages or
	third party tools as needed for a particular task.</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><a href="../../CLI/CLIPowerTools.html">CLI Power Tools</a></b> is a product
	offered by my own consulting company. It cuts 3 to 6
	months off the development time for a high-quality Cisco-like CLI.

	SNMP, Linux, Unix (Solaris), Embedded Systems, CVS, Networking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Highland Laboratories</b>, Ashland, MA -- Intermittent since Jan. 93</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Fully responsible for design and implementation of Linux device driver
	to control automatic paint-color dispenser. Interfaced with Linux internals,
	PCI interface card, and a front-end program written in MUMPS.
    The driver controls stepper motors using real-time, interrupt-driven
	logic written in C.</p>
    <p>Previously wrote low-level DOS driver in C++ for predecessor of same
	paint-color dispenser.</p>
    <p><u>Skills Used:</u> Linux internals, C, C++, 80x86 assembly language,

<p><strong>Nauticus Networks,</strong> Framingham, MA -- Mar 02 to Nov 02</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Designed embedded compiler to translate special pattern-recognition
    language into code for proprietary processor chip used in new
    wire-speed, intelligent load balancing switch for HTTP content. Resulting
    code needed to be extremely compact and utilize chip's special features.
    Worked with hardware chip design team to improve http chip's
    instruction set. Designed, implemented and documented assembler for same
    processor chip. Also implemented software emulation of some http chip
    features. Wrote programs for parsing parts of http protocol. </p>

<p><strong>Tenor Networks,</strong> Acton, MA -- Mar 01 to
Sep 01</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Designed and implemented new Command Line Interface (CLI)
    for high-speed MPLS service switch/router. Task requirements
    included the ability for multiple programmers to easily add
    new commands without significant revision-control collisions
    or merges. Solution was to create a language that allows each
    command or small group of commands to be described in a
    separate text file. A compiler reduced each file to small,
    efficient parse tables and a linker combined the parse tables
    and resolved potential conflicts. Run-time environment was
    C++ on OSE (an embedded operating system).</p>

	<p><u>Skills Used</u>: CLI, C++, compilers (lex, yacc), interpreters,
	SNMP, Unix (Solaris), Embedded (OSE), Clearcase, Networking.</p>

    selling point included powerful management capabilities. </p>

    <p>Wrote a compiler to translate command descriptions into
    run-time tables. Also wrote interpreter that used the
    run-time tables to recognize user's commands, report syntax
    errors, provide command completion, and provide
    context-sensitive help. Involved intense use of SNMPv3 for
    setting and retrieving router configuration. Application
    written on Linux in C++ with extensive use of Flex and Bison
