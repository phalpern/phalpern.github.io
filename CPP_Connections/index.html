<BIG>
<P>Memory allocators wee originally added to the Standard Template
Library (STL) for the purpose of supporting Intel x86 mixed-model
(near and far) pointers and other non-flat memory models.  Most
people, however, consider allocators to be a way to achieve
type-specific memory allocation for generic containers, generally for
improved efficiency.  This session will show that allocators, as
defined in the STL, do not serve either purpose well.  This session
will suggest specific refinements that require significant changes in
the way allocators work but yield tremendous payoffs in the power and
usability of allocators.  You’ll learn how these changes were
merged with the original STL model and produced a working, effective
memory allocation system that retains compatibility with the 1998
standard.  These experiences are the basis for a proposed enhancement
to the C++ Library for the next revision of the standard.</P>
